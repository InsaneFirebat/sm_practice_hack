================================================================
Features intentionally not ported
This isn't a forever list, nor is it an indictment
Most of these items are simply differences where both work
and there isn't much benefit in porting or backporting them
================================================================

- Resources folder structure and unusued resources

- Order of included sources

- Structure of defines.asm and main.asm (and separating printdebug.asm from main.asm)

- The SM Practice Hack title screen (the difference helps identify which practice hack is being used)

- Various sound effect macros

- Leading > or arrow on menu items, or menuing differences in general

- AREA_ID stored in custom presets

- Additional custom flags in the preset data

- Differences in room names

- Differences in preset file names or organization

- More controller shortcuts (I think we already have too many)

- The separate ih_update_timers routine (too much duplication with ih_update_hud_code)

- Tiny states fast flag (that was removed from main branch)

- Differences in how gamemode is implemented

- Differences in magic/space/loud pants implementation

- Differences in how scroll offsets are fixed

- Differences in how WRAM and SRAM are initialized

- Differences in PAL debug movement implementation

- Replacing TDC with LDA #$0000
